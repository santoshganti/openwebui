Assume that the probability density for a particular node is a two-dimensional Gaussian density. Sample observations O =(X, Y ) and the two marginal distributions p(X) and p(Y ) are shown in the ﬁgure below. (a) The two components X and Y of the output vector O are correlated. True or false? Inspect the ﬁgure and circle your answer True or False ? (b) How many real-valued parameters (= single numbers) are needed to deﬁne such a 2D output density model? (c) How would the Baum-Welch HMM training algorithm estimate the parameters of such a 2D output density model, given an observation sequence Ot? Provide the relevant formulas. 3 O s ie fun E Ym Efg pieceschandomfunMy EnnLay Egg a Ot Kit P Ye p q p of1 ee e f.at detfejkeHeDtEtn ed rise I Iete Eir E II Ht Mot KT if Repeatingtheprocess man Lu ie and E I E Epsilon 3 Adversarial Games Consider the game tree we discussed in our lecture to illustrate the Alpha-Beta Procedure. The numbers in boxes are time steps, the numbers directly under the leaf nodes are static evaluation scores. (a) Which move does the maximizer choose? The left, middle, or right? Circle the correct answer. (b) What are the values for ↵ and \u0000 at the node visited at time step 38? ↵ = \u0000 = (c) Why does the Alpha-Beta Procedure jump from the leaf node visited at time step 7 to the leaf node visited at time step 9 without checking the static values of the two leaves in between? The leaves visited at time steps 32, 34, and 36 have static values 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Your task is to explore what would happen if they had static values 10, 20, and 30 instead. (d) Which move does the maximizer choose? The left, middle, or right? Circle the answer. (e) Would the same number of nodes be pruned as in the original game tree? Yes or no? Circle the correct answer. 4 5 3 The value of 2 is 9 B is 8 at step 8 Our pruning ondition is 2 B at manimizingplayer and thus β cut off will cut As the above node is minimizing player and it does not want the α to get better so it cuts it moves on 4 A Collection of Topics Which statements are correct? Circle the item number of all correct answers. 1. Simulated annealing is a search mechanism that exhaustively checks every option in the solution space. 2. Since the number of leaf nodes in a game tree with a large branching factor is much larger than the number of non-leaf nodes, the iterative deepening heuristic does not produce much computational overlead compared to straight minimax. 3. In board games that involve two dice, the probability that a speciﬁc non-double roll occurs is 1/18. 4. Since Monte Carlo techniques attempt to sample the full event space of a game, they are used in stochastic games but not in deterministic games. 5. Because Poker is a partially observable stochastic game, the minimax procedure can only be applied to determine the move that provides the best expected minimax score. 6. In his guest lecture, Bertram Malle described a theoretical framework for a key aspect of robot ethics: the devel- opment and implementation of a robot’s moral competence. According to Malle, moral competence consists of ﬁve elements that are closely connected in humans but may come apart in artiﬁcial agents: moral action, moral judgment, moral communication, moral norms, and a moral vocabulary. 7. The A* algorithm uses underestimates of ”as-the-crow-ﬂies distances” to determine which partial path to ex- pand. 8. The A* algorithm is applied to the problem of robot path planning. 9. The ”greedy search with pruning algorithm” is typically implemented with a stack data structure. 10. In a robot 2D path planning problem, the visibility graph does not have an edge between two nodes if they represented fence posts that are located on opposite sides of the fence of an obstacle. 5 O O O O O O 5 Robot Path Planning (a) Draw the free space for the robot path planning problem shown below (draw appropriate fences around obstacles). Use the lower left corner of the triangle-shaped robot as its reference point.
